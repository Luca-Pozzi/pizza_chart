## How to use

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pizza_chart` comes with built-in images included, which can be freely used for non-commercial purposes (see [license](./LICENSE)).
> In using `pizza_chart`, the user can also use contents from any source, including third-party images. **It is the user's responsibility to give proper attribution to the authors of said contents.**

### Examples
* [`pizza_chart.ipynb`](./examples/pizza_chart.ipynb)
<br>Demonstrates how to use the `pizza_chart.plot` function to visualize pizza orders as a custom pie chart. Shows how to specify your order and customize the chartâ€™s appearance.

* [`pizza_maker.ipynb`](./examples/pizza_maker.ipynb)
<br>Lets you create new pizza images by combining base pizzas and toppings. Useful for generating assets for new pizza types, with interactive controls for customizing your pizza.

### Contribute
#### Add a pizza :pizza:
To add a new pizza to the assets, you have two main options:
* **Upload a picture.** Take a top-view picture of your pizza, ensuring that it is entirely visible.
Follow the tips in [ASSETS.md](./assets/ASSETS.md) to process it to the desired format, size and resolution.
* **Make a pizza with `pizza_maker.ipynb`.** See [_Examples_ section](#make-a-pizza-with-pizza_makeripynb).

#### Add a topping :tomato:
Get the picture of a topping by either:
* cropping a pizza from the images in [`assets/pizza`](./assets/pizzas)
* getting ingredients images from third-party sources ([Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) is a great place to look, if you are down with a cartoonish style).

### Report
Data collected during pizza days at [Politecnico di Milano - Polo Territoriale di Lecco](https://www.polo-lecco.polimi.it/) are available in [data.xlsx](./data/data.xlsx) Excel file.
The [`pizza_report.py`](./pizza_report.py) gathers data from the Excel file to generate summary charts regarding our pizza days. 
The updated summary is displayed at the top of this [`README`](README.md). Individual charts are available in [`assets/charts`](./assets/charts/).
