# Pizza chart

Pie charts, with a salty twist.

The purpose of this repository is to create a fun data visualization project to show our pizza preferences during pizza days at work. 
Data and the following summary stats refer to the pizza days at *Polo Territoriale di Lecco, Politecnico di Milano*.

While the data and summary stats are specific to our team, the core plotting function (`pizza_chart.plot`) and example notebooks are designed for anyone to use, adapt, and enjoy for their own pizza events or data visualization needs. See the rest of this README for more info.

## How to use

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pizza_chart` comes with built-in images included, which can be freely used for non-commercial purposes (see [license](./LICENSE)).
> In using `pizza_chart`, the user can also use contents from any source, including third-party images. **It is the user's responsibility to give proper attribution to the authors of said contents.**

### Examples
* [`pizza_chart.ipynb`](./examples/pizza_chart.ipynb)
<br>Demonstrates how to use the `pizza_chart.plot` function to visualize pizza orders as a custom pie chart. Shows how to specify your order and customize the chartâ€™s appearance.

* [`pizza_maker.ipynb`](./examples/pizza_maker.ipynb)
<br>Lets you create new pizza images by combining base pizzas and toppings. Useful for generating assets for new pizza types, with interactive controls for customizing your pizza.

### Contribute
#### Add a pizza image :pizza:
To add a new pizza to the assets, you have two main options:
* **Upload a picture.** Take a top-view picture of your pizza, ensuring that it is entirely visible.
Follow the tips in [`assets/README.md`](./assets/README.md) to process it to the desired format, size and resolution.
* **Make a pizza with `pizza_maker.ipynb`.** See [_Examples_ section](#make-a-pizza-with-pizza_makeripynb).

#### Add a topping image :tomato:
Users can add toppings to the assets by either:
* cropping a pizza from the images in [`assets/pizza`](./assets/pizzas)
* getting ingredients images from third-party sources ([Flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) is a great place to look, if you are down with a cartoonish style).

#### Add an order :clipboard:
> [!NOTE]
> Adding new orders is reserved for collaborators who have write access to this repo.

Data collected during pizza days at [Politecnico di Milano - Polo Territoriale di Lecco](https://www.polo-lecco.polimi.it/) are available in [data.xlsx](./data/data.xlsx) Excel file.
The [`pizza_report.py`](./pizza_report.py) gathers data from the Excel file to generate summary charts regarding our pizza days. 
The updated summary is displayed at the top of this [`README`](README.md). Individual charts are available in [`assets/charts`](./assets/charts/).

If you are a collaborator who wants to append new data:
* update the `input/data.csv` file 
* add new pizza images (with background removed, see [`assets/README.md`](./assets/README.md)) in `input/assets/pizzas` (if any)
* push your changes
* manually trigger the _Add new order_ worflow from the _Actions_ tab on GitHub
