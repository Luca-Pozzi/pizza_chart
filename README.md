# Pizza chart

Pie chart, with a salty twist.

> [!NOTE] The purpose of this repository is to create a fun data visualization representing the preferred pizzas during pizza days at work. Icons used in this project are sourced from Flaticon and credited according to Flaticonâ€™s attribution guidelines, which are listed in the [AUTHORS.md](./assets/AUTHORS.md) file.

## How to use

### Add a pizza
When a new pizza is added to the database, the corresponding image can be created using the [pizza_maker.ipynb](pizza_maker.ipynb) notebook. Run the notebook following the *How to use* instructions to compose and save your pizza.

### Add a topping
If the topping for your pizza is not available in the [toppings](./assets/toppings/) folder, you can add a proper PNG image, with the following procedure:
* find a suitable icon/drawing/illustration. [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) is the preferred source, but any image will do, provided that it comes with a license allowing redistribution.
* save the image with a meaningful name in the [toppings](./assets/toppings/) folder.

### Plot
Pizza charts can be plotted via the [pizza_chart.ipynb](pizza_chart.ipynb) notebook.
