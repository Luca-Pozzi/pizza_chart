## How to use

### Add a pizza
When a new pizza is added to the database, the corresponding image can be created using the [pizza_maker.ipynb](pizza_maker.ipynb) notebook. Run the notebook following the *How to use* instructions to compose and save your pizza.

### Add a topping
If the topping for your pizza is not available in the [toppings](./assets/toppings/) folder, you can add a proper PNG image, with the following procedure:
* find a suitable icon/drawing/illustration. [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) is the preferred source, but any image will do, provided that it comes with a license allowing redistribution.
* save the image with a meaningful name in the [toppings](./assets/toppings/) folder.
* add the acknowledgment to the authors in the [AUTHORS.md](./assets/AUTHORS.md) file.

### Plot
Pizza charts can be plotted via the [pizza_chart_example.ipynb](pizza_chart_example.ipynb) notebook.

### Report
Data collected during pizza days at [Politecnico di Milano - Polo Territoriale di Lecco](https://www.polo-lecco.polimi.it/) are available in [data.xlsx](./data/data.xlsx) Excel file.
The [`pizza_report.py`](./pizza_report.py) gathers data from the Excel file to generate summary charts regarding our pizza days. 
The updated summary is displayed at the top of this [`README`](README.md). Individual charts are available in [`assets/charts`](./assets/charts/).
